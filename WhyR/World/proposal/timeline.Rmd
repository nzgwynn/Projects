## Technical delivery

* Sets of videos will be released periodlically as a "season"
* Each season of the series will be contain about 10-12 videos.
* The videos will be approximately 15 minutes long.
* The videos will be recorded asynchronously (i.e. not livestreamed)

<!--
Covering the actual delivery of the project this section should provide at least a high-level the implementation. 

Including target dates is really important as you need to be committed and the ISC need to have a means of tracking delivery

## Other aspects

We will use Twitter and LinkedIn to find new team members and post when a new season is complete.

Covering non-technical activities like on-going publicity, paper preparation, discussion groups etc. that might be required to facilitate successful delivery of the project.
